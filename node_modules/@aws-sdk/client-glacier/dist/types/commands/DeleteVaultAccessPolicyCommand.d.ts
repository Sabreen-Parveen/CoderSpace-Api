/**
 * <p>This operation deletes the access policy associated with the specified vault. The
 *          operation is eventually consistent; that is, it might take some time for Amazon S3 Glacier to
 *          completely remove the access policy, and you might still see the effect of the policy for a
 *          short time after you send the delete request.</p>
 *          <p>This operation is idempotent. You can invoke delete multiple times, even if there is
 *          no policy associated with the vault. For more information about vault access policies, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-access-policy.html">Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies</a>. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GlacierClient, DeleteVaultAccessPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-glacier"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GlacierClient, DeleteVaultAccessPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-glacier"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GlacierClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteVaultAccessPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteVaultAccessPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteVaultAccessPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GlacierClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
